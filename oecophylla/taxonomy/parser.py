    Parameters
    ----------
    dir_bracken_reports : str
        Pathname of directory that contains bracken abundance estimation files
        per samples.

    Returns
    -------
    Pandas.DataFrame with rows for features, columns for samples.
    Feature labels are NCBI taxonomy IDs.

    Notes
    -----
    We don't know which files in the given directory are bracken abundance
    estimation files.
    Therefore, we iterate over all files and try to a) parse the file as a tab
    separated table and b) check if the second column is named 'taxonomy_id'.
